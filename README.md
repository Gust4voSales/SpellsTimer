<p align="center">Spells Timer is an overlay app (it stays on top of the window, and don't minimize) that helps you keep track of the enemies spells timers from League of Legends</p>

## ðŸ“œ About
This project aims to help League of Legends players. Usually when trying to keep track of enemies cooldowns, they have to do the math and send the time into the chat, while playing. With this app, we have much more control and ease to keep track of the cooldowns.

## ðŸŽ® How to use
- **Left click** in the spell will start the counter
- **Right click** in the spell will open the available spells list so you can switch
- Drag holding the right click in the arrow button to move the app
- Exit (really?)
